<h1>Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard</h1>
<p>This project is an individual project from my DS&AI course by Startup Campus.</p>

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/" target="_blank">Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle</a>. This dataset includes 13 features and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease. Below are the features included in the dataset:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>age</strong>: Age in years (ranging from 29 to 77)</li>
    <li><strong>sex</strong>: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)</li>
    <li><strong>cp</strong>: Chest pain type (4 values)</li>
    <li><strong>trestbps</strong>: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)</li>
    <li><strong>chol</strong>: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl</li>
    <li><strong>fbs</strong>: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)</li>
    <li><strong>restecg</strong>: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)</li>
    <li><strong>thalach</strong>: Maximum heart rate achieved</li>
    <li><strong>exang</strong>: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)</li>
    <li><strong>oldpeak</strong>: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest</li>
    <li><strong>slope</strong>: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment</li>
    <li><strong>ca</strong>: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy</li>
    <li><strong>thal</strong>: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)</li>
    <li><strong>target</strong>: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature Selection</h2>
In the interactive dashboard, I used several features including:

<h3>Metric</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Number of Patients</strong>: Record Count</li>
    <p>Show number of patients by number and percentage.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Dimension</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>age</strong></li>
    <p>Using age filter to see patients age distributions.</p>
    <li><strong>cp</strong></li>
    <p>To see the number of patients who suffer from heart disease based on the type of chest pain with 0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic.</p>
    <li><strong>trestbps</strong></li>
    <p>Show resting blood pressure per number of patients, add line for Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure.</p>
    <p><strong>Systolic</strong>: Pressure exerted when blood is ejected into arteries, normal is 120mmHg or below.</p>
    <p><strong>Diastolic</strong>: Pressure blood exerts within arteries between heartbeats, normal is 80mmHg or below.</p>
    <li><strong>thal</strong></li>
    <p>To see the number of patients who suffer from heart disease based on thalassemia with 0 = no, 1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect.</p>
    <li><strong>chol / target</strong></li>
    <p>Show serum cholesterol in mg/dl numbers by patients based on heart disease with target 0 = no, 1 = yes.</p>
    <li><strong>thalach</strong></li>
    <p>Show maximum heart rate achived numbers by patients based on heart disease with target 0 = no, 1 = yes.</p>
    <li><strong>sex</strong></li>
    <p>Sex distribution percetage based on number of patients and heart disease.</p>
</ul>
